title: "Not All Accuracy Is Equal: Prioritizing Diversity in Infectious Disease Forecasting"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
external_url: 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21191'
excerpt: 'This paper argues that epidemic forecasting ensembles often underperform because constituent models share correlated errors. It demonstrates that diversity in modeling approaches, not just individual accuracy, is the key driver of ensemble performance, and proposes strategies to design ensembles that maximize complementary information across models.'
