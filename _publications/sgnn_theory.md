title: "Learning From Simulators: A Theory of Simulation-Grounded Learning"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
external_url: 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18990'
excerpt: 'The paper presents a foundational theory for Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), showing that (i) they implement amortized Bayesian inference with a simulation prior and converge toward the Bayes-optimal predictor, and (ii) they can provably recover unobservable scientific quantities (with interpretability tied to the mechanistic simulation) even when empirical methods fail.'
